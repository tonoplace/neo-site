        <h3>About the site</h3>
        <p>I don't like most social media and I would really prefer to delete and block all of it, but for many reasons, that's not an option available to me. 
          I figured that I could just link people here from each of my separate social media profiles, so I wouldn't have to pick and choose what I post where. 
          And maybe, I can make something that is really my own, that people might enjoy reading or just looking at.</p>
        <p>This website is still very much under construction, so some things do not work yet or still need to be added. Look forward to these things I will add soon:
          <ul>
            <li><s>A footer</s> Done! Might reformat later.</li>
            <li><s>A functioning menu/navigation system</s> One functional link added. Now to add more!</li>
            <li>Blog posts sorted by theme using iframes -> this one's a work in progress.</li>
            <li>More pictures. The site is boring to look at right now. I'll make them myself</li>
            <li><s>Collection of interesting links</s> It's been added. However, I want it to look very different from the main page. That's a work-in-progress.</li>
            <li>A site button</li>
            <li>Alternate site themes (for accessibility and aesthetics)</li>
            <li><s>Different font faces</s> Done! I think this one fits the tone I'm going for better.</li>
            <li><s>Alt-text for all the pictures used on the site, for accessibility</s> So far, so good.</li>
            <li><s>Another sidebar, to the right. Not sure what I'll put in it yet (Changelog? Recent photos? 'Now playing'?)</s> Done! I might change the contents later.</li>
          </ul>
          Among other things.
        </p>
        <p>I will make time to work on this because it's important to me to be able to use simple CSS and HTML.</p>

        <p>I made a bingo card for this year, inspired by <a href="https://evy.garden/notebook/bingo/">this article</a> on the lovely <a href="evy.garden">evy.garden website.</a> The site is a huge source of inspiration for me at the moment, so please check it out.</p>
