    <h3>Hi!</h3>
    <p>I'm making this page because the modern internet has become totally homogenised and difficult (if not impossible) to customize.</p>
    <p>It's hard to find the time to work on this site, but I'm doing my best.</p>

    <h3>On loop recently...</h3>
    <p><i>Check out the archive of past songs and comments <a href= "on-loop-archive.html">here.</a></i></p>
    <p>The song of the moment is "Control" by Mr. Mister.</p>

    <p>What a catchy song, and one with lyrics that resonate as well. I have trouble letting go of the need for control in my life. It's a sort of coping mechanism to deal with the uncertainty that comes with freedom. I think it's a natural response to the boundless possibilities created by globalisation and the internet. There used to be things outside of our influence that we simply accepted as fact. Alternatively, there was not enough information about it. In a way, that was freeing. One fewer thing to worry about. Now, you can potentially influence anythingâ€” and there's so much know-how that we're all expected to perform as though we've trawled through the entire internet and absorbed all of its knowledge. But where do we decide that it's been enough?</p>
