  <h3>Japan</h3>
  <p>Commentary on Japanese society often falls into the trap of assuming that Japan and its people are somehow unique in the world, which is a massive oversimplification.
    This leads people to suggest overly easy 'solutions' to problems faced by Japanese society.
    I've studied Japan and the Japanese language since 2021 now, and I've lived there for a good year as well. 
    That's really nothing in the grand scheme of things. 
    I do have some observations and thoughts that I would like to share.
    I'll do my best to avoid oversimplifications while providing some food for thought.
