  <h3>The Digital Pillow Book</h3>
  <p>During the Heian Period in Japan (794 to 1185), there was a woman called Sei Sh≈çnagon, who recorded the ins and outs of life in the Heian court in what is called the 'Pillow Book'.
    I especially like the various lists she wrote, ranging from the names of various buildings and festivals, to things that annoyed her. So, I decided to make a Pillow Book for the 21st century: the Digital Pillow Book.
    I sometimes write lists in my phone's notes application, so I have a backlog that I will reformat and upload shortly. See the titles below:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="dpb-moving.html">Things that are moving</a></li>
      <li>Things that are infuriating</li>
      <li>Things that are dismaying</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
