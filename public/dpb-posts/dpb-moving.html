  <h3>Things that are moving</h3>
  <p>
    The ring of a wind chime in the early summer breeze.
    <br>
    The smell and feel of freshly-washed cotton sheets, still warm from the dryer.
    <br>
    Happening upon frogspawn in a pond and seeing the little tadpoles move about inside.
    <br>
    You're out running errands, and are about to pass someone on the sidewalk. You're in a good mood, so you give them a smile and a hello, and their face lights up a little and they return the favor.
    <br>
    You're out walking on a warm summer day, and a cool breeze lifts your hair off your shoulders.
    <br>
    The strangely sweet aftertaste of licorice root tea.
