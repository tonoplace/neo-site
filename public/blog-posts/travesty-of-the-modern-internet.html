  <p><i>You've probably noticed that the internet has become increasingly stale over the past few years. Theories such as 'dead internet' have begun to crop up, suggesting that the internet is now populated mostly by bots posting spamâ€” that there are few 'real people' creating 'real content' left. While I have a hard time believing things have gotten to that point yet, I do think the theory has some merit. I want to talk about that some more.</i></p>
